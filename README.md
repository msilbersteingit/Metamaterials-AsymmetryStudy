# Metamaterials-AsymmetryStudy
Codes used for the paper covering a study of symmetry and asymmetry in lattice-based metamaterials

The file primary_analysis_code.m contains all the code used in the body of the paper, while secondary_analysis_code.m additionally contains functions used to generate plots in the supplementary information of the paper.  Included in primary_analysis_code.m is the implementation of the finite-element beam model used to study each lattice design.  Using the beam model requires the
